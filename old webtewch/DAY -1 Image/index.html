                The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila (Hindi pronunciation: [laːl 'qɪlaː]), is an historic Mughal fort
            located in the Old Delhi area of Delhi, India. It served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
            Commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan on the 12th of May 1639, the fort was constructed following his decision
            to shift the Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally adorned in red and white, the fort's design is
            attributed to Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the architect of the Taj Mahal. The Red Fort is a prominent example of
            Mughal architecture from Shah Jahan's reign, combining Persian and Indian architectural styles.
